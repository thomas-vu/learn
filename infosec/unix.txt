ls -l (long format) -a (show all files)

The Long Format
     If the -l option is given, the following information is displayed for each file: file mode,
     number of links, owner name, group name, number of bytes in the file, abbreviated month,
     day-of-month file was last modified, hour file last modified, minute file last modified, and
     the pathname.  In addition, for each directory whose contents are displayed, the total num-
     ber of 512-byte blocks used by the files in the directory is displayed on a line by itself,
     immediately before the information for the files in the directory.  If the file or directory
     has extended attributes, the permissions field printed by the -l option is followed by a '@'
     character.  Otherwise, if the file or directory has extended security information (such as
     an access control list), the permissions field printed by the -l option is followed by a '+'
     character.

     If the modification time of the file is more than 6 months in the past or future, then the
     year of the last modification is displayed in place of the hour and minute fields.

     If the owner or group names are not a known user or group name, or the -n option is given,
     the numeric ID's are displayed.
